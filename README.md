# sandwich-economics
This is an analysis of sandwich attack economics on constant product market makers like Uniswap. I ultimately examine the optimal order of sandwich attackers if they were to cooperate. This notebook uses a visualization tool called Panel, and the plots won't render in github. Either clone the repo and run the notebook, or follow this link to a google colab of the same notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18c5lV6lRf5o6CmY5gIOQDXNY0HGEgFAY?usp=sharing
